# Sex- and Age-Specific Functional Connectomics in Autism (ABIDE I)

This repository contains the analysis code for my CPSC 599 term project on **sex- and age-specific functional connectivity differences in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** using the **ABIDE I** dataset and the **CC200** functional atlas.

The project builds whole-brain functional networks, computes graph-theoretic measures (small-worldness, modularity, hub metrics), and compares **ASD vs. control** groups separately in **females vs. males** and across **child, teen, and young adult** age bands.

## 1. Project Goals

**High-level research questions**

1. **RQ1 – Development:**  
   Do ASD vs. control differences in **female functional connectivity** change with age?

2. **RQ2 – Network specificity:**  
   Are there specific **network pairs / edge clusters** that differ between ASD and control females?

3. **RQ3 – Modularity and hubs:**  
   Do females with ASD show differences in **modularity (Q)** and **hub roles**  
   (participation coefficient, within-module degree *z*) compared to controls?

**Short answer**

- Networks in all groups show **strong small-world organization** and broadly similar large-scale topology.
- **Female ASD** shows **age-dependent, network-specific** connectivity differences  
  – broad ASD > control hyperconnectivity in childhood, more mixed patterns in teens, and subtle effects in young adults.
- **Male ASD** shows a more **stable pattern** with slightly reduced between-module connectivity from teen years onward.
- **Modularity and hub roles** (Q, PC, *z*) are **largely similar** between ASD and control females, with only small, non-robust differences in a few modules.
